## Introduction

Hi, welcome to my blog where I discuss my perspectives and share (sometimes) research on items which I think are relevant. You'll find that as a researcher that I focus on ethical aspects of Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and the dangers that any technology that is misused can be a short-term win, but a long-term fail in terms of your organizational culture. The concept of "the beatings will continue until morale improves" does not apply in leading organizations of any kind, even the military. Although I support many thought leaders in the areas of leadership (Greenleaf, Northouse, Yukl, Brown, Treviño, Harrison, and more). I tend to focus on the areas of ethical leadership (Brown, Treviño, Harrison, and Northouse) which extends into charismatic and transformational leadership, and some might even argue a lesser known, chamelion type of leadership. All of this, of course applies to all aspects of both for-profit, non-profit, and government 'businessses'. Just as the words every data consultant hears from pretty much every customer, "but our data is different." No, it's not. the application of the data, the misuse of the data, the bad practices around data management might be, but data in order to become useful information remains the same irregardless of platform, with the only caveat that the perspective of the data shifts amongst the consumers of the data be it retail, sales teams, finance teams, and shipping orgs to name a few. Either way, if you ever have any questions, please drop me an email.
